This is an example of the index system used in
in the empire.  All 32'dragons are numbered and 
labeled using Roman Numerals followed by S it they 
reside on Solana, or P if they reside on Polygon.  
This is followed by the Shades of Grey assigned to each 
genesis which are Indexed A thru H and each grey is 
given 125 named colors that will be indexed and numbered
1 thru 125.  The decimal value that you see in the 
chart is a level of the color's brightness from lowest to highest
with the lowest being black and the highest bring white.  Yhe official 
empire hierarchy ftom 1 ti 32 is the essentially the same, though the first 
owners will have seniority over later members and that position of seniority 
will be revognized as first or second and so on..Of course the longer the vault 
is compounding then of course it's corresponding nft will be that much more valuable 
to the owner than one that mints at a later date, and its advantages shoild be obvious..
These Genesis dragon owners will have a premier position in this empire and they will have 
the opportunity to realize a substantial amount of passive income that will
resonate from all levels and tiers...If someone tells you
that this is a great opportunity for someone looking to make some 'real' income then you 
might just want to pay attention so you don't miss the opportunity of a lifetime to become a member at this level 
because the benefits as you will see will go far beyond just oassive income, though that is 
quite desirous and you will find yourself questioning the project...This is UNLIKIJE no other project as this project 
will resonate as too good to be true...Well let me tell you that is the way it is designed...
This empire has a strong desire to bendfit those who are lucky enough, those who are smart enough, and surely 
those who are bold enough, to try something that will be fully transparebt...It will operate entirely by charter
and it will be governed soley by those who have vision and those who have a desire to make some money, not necessarily in the traditional 
work hard and punch a time clock image.  This empire is as classy as any and will rival some of the best projects that are acailable in 2026 and once it gains 
traction it will be it's own economy
and it will at a minimum rival those economies that have gdp in the high hundreds of billions
and this is a very conservative view tor you are in yhe midst of history being made whether you join or not this empire moves towards an epic existence that will 
be unstoppable as people see 
the beauty of compounded interest creating passive income that you can comfortably watch as it grows into something that maybe 
you could change your lifestyle a bit...For some this empire will make them members of a group that many seek, but few attain, but with the implementation of cryptocurrency 
more millionaires are created each day than ever before with the old system of finance.  So welcome to The Color of Your Money...This empire will be fully disclosed within these pages...The 
official structure will follow...
