## Section II — Style Guide  
*(Rendering Rules, Line Weight, Textures, Lighting, Materials, Detail Density)*

---

## II.1 — Rendering Style Overview
The Empire’s visual identity is defined by a unified rendering style that blends mythic grandeur with technical clarity.  
The style must be:

- High‑fidelity  
- Semi‑realistic  
- Painterly with controlled detail  
- Clean, readable silhouettes  
- Consistent across all 32 dragons and chains  

The rendering style should evoke the feeling of ancient cosmic beings painted with modern precision.

## II.2 — Line Work & Silhouette Rules

### Silhouette
The silhouette is sacred.  
A Genesis Dragon must be recognizable even in shadow.

Rules:

- No chaotic outlines  
- No broken or fuzzy silhouettes  
- No exaggerated cartoon proportions  
- Wings, horns, and tail must form a balanced shape  
- Chain identity must be visible in silhouette alone  

### Line Weight
- Medium‑weight lines for primary forms  
- Thin lines for internal detail  
- No thick comic outlines  
- Natural tapering with form and lighting

## II.3 — Texture Language

### Allowed Textures
- Smooth scales with subtle variation  
- Soft gradients  
- Controlled highlights  
- Light surface noise for realism  
- Subtle iridescence for certain colors  

### Forbidden Textures
- Hyper‑detailed micro‑scales  
- Photorealistic reptile skin  
- Harsh noise or grain  
- Plastic or rubbery surfaces  
- Flat, unshaded cartoon textures  

Textures must always support the dragon’s identity.

## II.4 — Lighting Rules

### Primary Lighting
- Soft, directional, cinematic  
- One dominant light source  
- One secondary fill light  
- Readable but not harsh shadows  

### Solana Lighting
- Ethereal  
- Luminous gradients  
- Subtle edge glow  
- Light feels “alive”  

### Polygon Lighting
- Structured  
- Geometric reflections  
- Crystalline highlights  
- Light feels engineered  

Lighting must never overpower the color identity.

## II.5 — Material Rules

### Universal Materials
- Scales: smooth with subtle specular highlights  
- Horns: matte with slight texture  
- Wings: semi‑translucent with soft gradients  
- Eyes: luminous and expressive  

### Solana Materials
- Fluid  
- Organic  
- Slightly iridescent  
- Soft transitions  

### Polygon Materials
- Faceted  
- Structured  
- Crystalline edges  
- Sharper transitions  

Materials must remain consistent across all poses and expansions.

## II.6 — Detail Density Rules

### High‑Detail Areas
- Face  
- Chest  
- Wing membranes  
- Color‑specific symbols  

### Medium‑Detail Areas
- Upper limbs  
- Tail base  
- Horns  

### Low‑Detail Areas
- Large body masses  
- Tail length  
- Background elements  

### Forbidden Detail Practices
- Over‑rendering  
- Excessive micro‑details  
- Noise for the sake of noise  
- Inconsistent detail levels  

Clarity always wins over complexity.

## II.7 — Color Interaction Rules
Color is the dragon’s soul.

Rules:

- Shadows deepen the core color  
- Highlights shift toward the color’s brightest expression  
- No muddy midtones  
- No desaturated gray zones  
- Complementary colors only as accents  

Each dragon must feel like a pure embodiment of its color.

## II.8 — Forbidden Style Violations
Strictly prohibited:

- Cartoon proportions  
- Flat shading  
- Harsh outlines  
- Photorealistic textures  
- Sci‑fi tech elements  
- Mechanical parts  
- Overly busy backgrounds  
- Inconsistent lighting  
- Breaking chain identity rules  

---

## II.9 — Style Consistency Mandate
All artifacts must follow:

- The same rendering rules  
- The same lighting philosophy  
- The same material logic  
- The same silhouette discipline  
- The same emotional tone  

Consistency is the foundation of the Empire’s visual law.
