## III. LIGHTING RULES
- Extremely low-key lighting with strong shadows.
- Single directional light source from behind or above.
- Highlights only on edges of horns, claws, and wing ridges.
- Ambient light should be minimal to preserve the stealth aesthetic.
- Subtle fog or dust catching faint light around the dragon.
