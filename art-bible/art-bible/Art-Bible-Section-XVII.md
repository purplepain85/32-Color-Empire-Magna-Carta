# ART BIBLE v1.0  
## Section XVII — Artist Workflow & Production Pipeline  
*(Creation Order, Review Stages, Consistency Checks, Approval Flow)*

---

## XVII.1 — Purpose of the Production Pipeline
The Empire’s visual identity must remain:

- Consistent  
- Predictable  
- Reproducible  
- Scalable  
- Immutable  

This pipeline ensures every Genesis Dragon is created with the same discipline and ceremonial precision.

---

## XVII.2 — The Five‑Stage Creation Pipeline
Every Genesis Dragon must pass through **five mandatory stages**:

1. **Color Identity Lock‑In**  
2. **Anatomy & Silhouette Draft**  
3. **Symbolic Geometry Integration**  
4. **Lighting & Material Pass**  
5. **Final Rendering & Chain Variants**

No stage may be skipped.

---

## XVII.3 — Stage 1: Color Identity Lock‑In
Before any artwork begins:

- Select the color from the 32‑Color Pantheon  
- Review emotional and metaphysical identity  
- Review symbolic geometry family  
- Review chain‑specific visual rules  
- Confirm color purity and forbidden hues  

The color identity is the dragon’s soul — it must be locked first.

---

## XVII.4 — Stage 2: Anatomy & Silhouette Draft
The artist creates:

- A clean silhouette  
- Approved anatomical proportions  
- Wing, horn, and tail variants  
- Pose category alignment  
- No details, no textures, no lighting  

This stage focuses solely on **shape and presence**.

Forbidden at this stage:

- Color  
- Lighting  
- Background  
- Symbols  
- Texture  

Only silhouette matters.

---

## XVII.5 — Stage 3: Symbolic Geometry Integration
Once the silhouette is approved:

- Add primary symbol (chest)  
- Add secondary symbol (wings/horns)  
- Add optional accent symbol  
- Ensure geometry matches Court and color family  
- Ensure placement follows Section VII rules  

Symbols must feel carved into destiny, not pasted on.

---

## XVII.6 — Stage 4: Lighting & Material Pass
The artist applies:

- Approved lighting hierarchy  
- Chain‑specific light behavior  
- Material rules for scales, horns, wings, eyes  
- Color‑aligned shadows and highlights  
- Subtle aura behavior  

Forbidden:

- Neon  
- Sci‑fi effects  
- Harsh contrast  
- Photorealistic micro‑detail  

Lighting defines mythic presence.

---

## XVII.7 — Stage 5: Final Rendering & Chain Variants
The final stage includes:

- Solana variant (fluid, organic, luminous)  
- Polygon variant (structured, crystalline, precise)  
- Background complexity level  
- Aura refinement  
- Final silhouette clarity check  

Both variants must feel like the same dragon expressed through different cosmic laws.

---

## XVII.8 — Mandatory Review Checkpoints
Each stage requires approval before moving forward:

- **Color Review**  
- **Silhouette Review**  
- **Symbol Review**  
- **Lighting Review**  
- **Final Review**  

No stage may proceed without explicit approval.

---

## XVII.9 — Forbidden Workflow Practices
These break the Empire’s production law:

- Starting with color before silhouette  
- Adding symbols before silhouette approval  
- Adding lighting before symbol integration  
- Mixing chain styles  
- Using unapproved materials  
- Deviating from the five‑stage pipeline  

The pipeline is sacred.

---

## XVII.10 — Production Consistency Mandate
All artists must follow:

- The same five‑stage pipeline  
- The same review checkpoints  
- The same chain‑specific rules  
- The same color metaphysics  
- The same symbolic geometry logic  

The production pipeline is the Empire’s creative constitution.  
It must remain unchanged across all eras, artists, and expansions.
