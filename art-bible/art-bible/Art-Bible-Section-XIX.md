# ART BIBLE v1.0  
## Section XIX — Expansion & Future‑Proofing Rules  
*(New Colors, New Courts, New Chains, New Species, Long‑Term Consistency)*

---

## XIX.1 — Purpose of Expansion Rules
The Empire must be able to grow **without breaking itself**.  
Expansion rules ensure:

- New content remains compatible  
- The Pantheon stays balanced  
- Visual identity stays unified  
- Lore remains coherent  
- Metadata remains stable  
- Collectibility remains protected  

Expansion must feel like discovery, not revision.

---

## XIX.2 — The Four Expansion Categories
All future additions must fall into one of these categories:

1. **New Colors**  
2. **New Courts**  
3. **New Chains**  
4. **New Species**

No other expansion types are allowed.

---

## XIX.3 — Rules for Adding New Colors
New colors must:

- Fit into the 32‑Color Pantheon structure  
- Have a clear emotional identity  
- Have a clear metaphysical identity  
- Have a unique symbolic geometry family  
- Not duplicate or overlap existing colors  
- Not contradict existing lore  

Forbidden:

- Neon colors  
- Metallic colors  
- Sci‑fi colors  
- Colors that break the Pantheon’s emotional logic  

New colors must feel ancient and inevitable.

---

## XIX.4 — Rules for Adding New Courts
New Courts must:

- Represent a fundamental cosmic force  
- Have a unique symbolic geometry language  
- Have a distinct emotional tone  
- Have a clear metaphysical domain  
- Not overlap with existing Courts  
- Not contradict the Empire’s cosmology  

Courts must feel like pillars of creation.

---

## XIX.5 — Rules for Adding New Chains
New chains must:

- Have a distinct visual philosophy  
- Have a distinct metadata style  
- Have a distinct lore tone  
- Maintain full compatibility with existing dragons  
- Never alter existing dragons  
- Never break cross‑chain consistency rules  

Chains may differ in **expression**, never in **essence**.

---

## XIX.6 — Rules for Adding New Species
New species must:

- Follow the same constitutional structure  
- Have their own anatomy rules  
- Have their own symbolic geometry rules  
- Have their own color metaphysics  
- Have their own Courts or sub‑Courts  
- Never contradict dragon identity  

Species must expand the Empire, not dilute it.

---

## XIX.7 — Forbidden Expansion Practices
These break the Empire’s future‑proofing law:

- Retconning existing dragons  
- Changing existing colors  
- Changing existing lore  
- Changing existing symbolic geometry  
- Adding modern or sci‑fi elements  
- Adding comedic or cartoon species  
- Adding traits that contradict the Pantheon  

Expansion must honor what came before.

---

## XIX.8 — Expansion Approval Workflow
All expansions must pass:

1. **Lore Review**  
2. **Color Metaphysics Review**  
3. **Symbolic Geometry Review**  
4. **Visual Identity Review**  
5. **Metadata Review**  
6. **Final Constitutional Approval**

No expansion is valid without all six approvals.

---

## XIX.9 — Long‑Term Consistency Mandate
All future expansions must:

- Follow the same constitutional laws  
- Follow the same visual identity  
- Follow the same metaphysical structure  
- Follow the same symbolic geometry logic  
- Follow the same chain‑specific rules  
- Follow the same rarity logic  

The Empire must grow **without ever fracturing**.

---

## XIX.10 — The Eternal Rule
Expansion must always feel like:

- Revelation  
- Discovery  
- Destiny  

Never revision, contradiction, or reinvention.

The Empire must remain eternal, unified, and sovereign across all future eras.
