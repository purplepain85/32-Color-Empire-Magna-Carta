# ART BIBLE v1.0  
## The Visual Constitution of the 32‑Color Empire  
*(Structure • Identity • Law • Eternity)*

---

## Purpose of the Art Bible
The Art Bible is the **official visual constitution** of the 32‑Color Empire.  
It defines:

- What a Genesis Dragon is  
- How it must look  
- How it must behave  
- How it must be rendered  
- How it must be expanded  
- What is forever forbidden  

This document ensures that every artist, developer, contributor, and future expansion follows the same eternal laws.

The Art Bible is not a style guide.  
It is **law**.

---

## What the Art Bible Contains
The Art Bible v1.0 is divided into **20 sections**, grouped into six major domains:

### **I. Foundational Structure**
- Purpose, scope, color metaphysics, chain identity

### **II. Anatomy & Geometry**
- Dragon anatomy, silhouette categories, symbolic geometry

### **III. Materials, Lighting & Metadata**
- Material rules, lighting hierarchy, aura behavior, metadata structure

### **IV. Lore & Presentation**
- Lore tone, Sigil Page rules, Dragon Page layout

### **V. Production & Quality Control**
- Artist workflow, QC standards, cross‑chain consistency

### **VI. Expansion & Immutable Law**
- Future‑proofing rules and the eternal laws of the Empire

Each section is self‑contained, constitutional, and immutable.

## Versioning
**Art Bible v1.0**  
This is the first complete, immutable version of the Empire’s visual constitution.

Future updates (v1.1, v2.0, etc.) may add expansions, but **no existing laws may be altered** without constitutional approval.

---

## Philosophy
The Art Bible is built on five eternal pillars:

1. **Color Metaphysics**  
2. **Symbolic Geometry**  
3. **Anatomical Sovereignty**  
4. **Chain Duality**  
5. **Constitutional Consistency**

These pillars ensure the Empire remains unified across:

- Chains  
- Artists  
- Eras  
- Expansions  
- Technologies  

The Empire endures because its foundation never changes.

It protects the dragons.  
It protects the lore.  
It protects the future.
