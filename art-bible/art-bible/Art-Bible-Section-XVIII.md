# ART BIBLE v1.0  
## Section XVIII — Quality Control & Approval Standards  
*(Review Criteria, Error Classes, Consistency Enforcement, Final Sign‑Off)*

---

## XVIII.1 — Purpose of Quality Control
Quality Control (QC) ensures that every Genesis Dragon:

- Meets the Empire’s visual laws  
- Matches its metadata  
- Reflects its color metaphysics  
- Aligns with chain‑specific identity  
- Maintains collectible‑grade consistency  

QC is the Empire’s shield against inconsistency.

---

## XVIII.2 — The Three QC Layers
Every dragon must pass through:

1. **Visual QC**  
2. **Metadata QC**  
3. **Lore QC**

All three layers must approve the dragon before it is finalized.

---

## XVIII.3 — Visual QC Criteria
Visual QC checks for:

- Correct silhouette  
- Correct anatomy  
- Correct symbolic geometry placement  
- Correct lighting hierarchy  
- Correct material behavior  
- Correct background complexity  
- Correct aura behavior  
- Chain‑specific style accuracy  
- No forbidden elements  

If any visual rule is broken, the dragon fails QC.

---

## XVIII.4 — Metadata QC Criteria
Metadata QC checks for:

- Correct trait categories  
- Correct rarity tier  
- Correct chain identity  
- Correct color identity  
- No duplicate traits  
- No contradictory traits  
- No unapproved descriptors  
- No missing fields  

Metadata must match the artwork **exactly**.

---

## XVIII.5 — Lore QC Criteria
Lore QC checks for:

- Correct color metaphysics  
- Correct chain tone  
- Correct symbolic geometry meaning  
- Correct Court alignment  
- No modern references  
- No sci‑fi elements  
- No comedic tone  
- No contradictions with visuals  

Lore must feel ancient, mythic, and constitutional.

---

## XVIII.6 — Error Classes
Errors are classified into three categories:

### **Class I — Critical Errors**
These break the Empire’s laws:
- Wrong color  
- Wrong anatomy  
- Wrong symbolic geometry  
- Wrong chain identity  
- Forbidden visual elements  
- Metadata contradictions  

**Automatic rejection.**

### **Class II — Major Errors**
These break consistency:
- Incorrect lighting  
- Incorrect material behavior  
- Incorrect background complexity  
- Incorrect aura behavior  
- Incorrect pose category  

**Requires revision.**

### **Class III — Minor Errors**
These break polish:
- Slight color imbalance  
- Minor spacing issues  
- Slightly inconsistent glow  
- Small metadata formatting issues  

**Requires correction but not redesign.**

---

## XVIII.7 — QC Workflow
The QC workflow follows this order:

1. **Visual QC**  
2. **Metadata QC**  
3. **Lore QC**  
4. **Final Approval**

A dragon cannot advance until the previous layer approves it.

## XVIII.8 — Forbidden QC Practices
These violate the Empire’s standards:

- Approving a dragon with known errors  
- Skipping QC layers  
- Allowing chain variants
