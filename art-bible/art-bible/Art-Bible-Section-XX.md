# ART BIBLE v1.0  
## Section XX — The Immutable Laws of the Empire  
*(Foundational Principles, Eternal Constraints, Non‑Negotiable Standards)*

---

## XX.1 — Purpose of the Immutable Laws
These laws define the **unchangeable core** of the Empire.  
They ensure:

- Eternal consistency  
- Visual sovereignty  
- Lore integrity  
- Cross‑chain unity  
- Protection against drift  
- Preservation of the Empire’s mythic identity  

These laws cannot be revised, overridden, or reinterpreted.

---

## XX.2 — The Five Eternal Pillars
The Empire is built on five unbreakable pillars:

1. **Color Metaphysics**  
2. **Symbolic Geometry**  
3. **Anatomical Sovereignty**  
4. **Chain Duality**  
5. **Constitutional Consistency**

If any pillar breaks, the Empire collapses.

---

## XX.3 — Eternal Law I: Color Metaphysics
Color identity is sacred.

- Each color has a fixed emotional meaning  
- Each color has a fixed metaphysical domain  
- Each color has a fixed symbolic geometry family  
- No color may be redefined  
- No color may be merged or split  
- No color may contradict its Pantheon role  

Color is the soul of the Empire.

---

## XX.4 — Eternal Law II: Symbolic Geometry
Symbolic geometry is the Empire’s cosmic language.

- Each symbol has a fixed meaning  
- Each symbol belongs to a specific Court  
- Each symbol belongs to a specific color family  
- Placement rules are immutable  
- Geometry cannot be redesigned or modernized  

Symbols are the Empire’s scripture.

---

## XX.5 — Eternal Law III: Anatomical Sovereignty
The Genesis Dragon’s anatomy is fixed.

- Proportions are immutable  
- Silhouette categories are immutable  
- Wing, horn, and tail variants are immutable  
- No new anatomical features may be added  
- No existing features may be removed  

Anatomy is the Empire’s physical truth.

---

## XX.6 — Eternal Law IV: Chain Duality
The Empire exists across two chains:

- **Solana** (fluid, organic, luminous)  
- **Polygon** (structured, crystalline, precise)

Chain differences may express **style**, but never **identity**.

Forbidden:

- Divergent poses  
- Divergent anatomy  
- Divergent symbols  
- Divergent rarity  
- Divergent lore meaning  

Chains may differ in expression, never in essence.

---

## XX.7 — Eternal Law V: Constitutional Consistency
All content must follow:

- The same visual laws  
- The same metadata structure  
- The same lore metaphysics  
- The same symbolic geometry rules  
- The same production pipeline  
- The same QC standards  

Consistency is the Empire’s immortality.

---

## XX.8 — Forbidden Violations of the Immutable Laws
These acts are strictly prohibited:

- Retconning existing dragons  
- Redefining colors  
- Redesigning symbols  
- Altering anatomy  
- Introducing modern or sci‑fi elements  
- Breaking chain unity  
- Adding unapproved expansion types  
- Violating the production pipeline  
- Skipping QC layers  

These violations fracture the Empire and are never allowed.

---

## XX.9 — Eternal Preservation Protocol
To preserve the Empire across eras:

- All documents must remain accessible  
- All rules must remain unchanged  
- All expansions must follow Section XIX  
- All artists must follow Section XVII  
- All QC must follow Section XVIII  
- All chain variants must follow Section XVI  

The Empire must remain sovereign across centuries.

---

## XX.10 — The Final Mandate
The Art Bible is the **visual constitution** of the Empire.  
It defines:

- What a Genesis Dragon is  
- What a Genesis Dragon can be  
- What a Genesis Dragon must never become  

These laws are eternal.  
These laws are sacred.  
These laws are immutable.

The Empire endures because its foundation never changes.
