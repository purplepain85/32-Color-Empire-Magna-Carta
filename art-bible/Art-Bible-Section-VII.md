## Section VII — Symbolic Geometry System  
*(Sacred Shapes, Color Symbols, Chain Variants, Integration Rules)*

---

## VII.1 — Purpose of Symbolic Geometry
Symbolic geometry is the Empire’s sacred visual language.  
Every color, dragon, chain, and artifact uses geometry to express:

- Metaphysical identity  
- Emotional resonance  
- Governance role  
- Cosmic hierarchy  

Symbols are not decoration — they are law.

---

## VII.2 — Universal Geometry Principles
All symbols in the Empire must follow these rules:

- Clean, precise lines  
- Perfect symmetry unless intentionally broken  
- No excessive complexity  
- No sci‑fi circuitry  
- No cartoon shapes  
- Geometry must reinforce color identity  

Symbols must feel ancient, mythic, and mathematically inevitable.

## VII.3 — The Four Geometric Families
Each Court has its own geometric language:

### **1. Court of Light — Circular Geometry**
- Rings  
- Halos  
- Concentric circles  
- Radiant arcs  
Represents clarity, ascension, and illumination.

### **2. Court of Flame — Angular Geometry**
- Triangles  
- Sharp flares  
- Radiant spikes  
- Directional arrows  
Represents will, momentum, and transformation.

### **3. Court of Earth — Organic Geometry**
- Spirals  
- Leaf‑like curves  
- Rooted shapes  
- Soft symmetry  
Represents growth, balance, and renewal.

### **4. Court of Shadow — Fractured Geometry**
- Sharp symmetry  
- Broken lines  
- Blade‑like shapes  
- Interlocking forms  
Represents judgment, memory, and the unseen.

Each family must remain visually distinct.

## VII.4 — Color‑Specific Symbol Rules
Each of the 32 colors has:

- **One primary symbol**  
- **One secondary symbol**  
- **One optional accent symbol**  

These symbols appear on:

- Dragon chest  
- Wing membranes  
- Horn or crest  
- Background elements  
- UI and metadata  

Symbols must always match the color’s metaphysical identity.

## VII.5 — Solana vs. Polygon Symbol Variants

### **Solana Symbol Style**
- Softer curves  
- Fluid transitions  
- Luminous edges  
- Organic glow  
- Slight asymmetry allowed  

### **Polygon Symbol Style**
- Sharper angles  
- Faceted edges  
- Crystalline precision  
- Structured glow  
- Perfect symmetry preferred  

Both variants must remain recognizable as the same symbol.

---

## VII.6 — Symbol Placement Rules
Symbols must be placed with intention:

### **Primary Symbol**
- Chest or upper torso  
- Must be clearly visible  
- Must not be distorted by pose  

### **Secondary Symbol**
- Wings, horns, or tail base  
- Must support silhouette clarity  

### **Accent Symbol**
- Optional  
- Used sparingly  
- Must not clutter the design  

Symbol placement must enhance, not distract.

## VII.7 — Forbidden Symbol Practices
These break the Empire’s visual law:

- Overlapping symbols  
- Random symbol placement  
- Excessive symbol repetition  
- Neon or glowing outlines that overpower the dragon  
- Symbols that contradict color identity  
- Symbols that mimic real‑world alphabets or runes  

Symbols must remain pure and mythic.

## VII.8 — Symbol Integration with Color & Anatomy
Symbols must integrate seamlessly with:

- The dragon’s anatomy  
- The color’s emotional signature  
- The chain’s visual expression  
- The pose and silhouette  

Symbols must feel like they are part of the
