# ART BIBLE v1.0  
## Section V — Color Identity System  
*(Meaning, Emotion, Symbolism, Chain Variants)*

---

## V.1 — Purpose of the Color Identity System
Color is the soul of the Empire.  
Each Genesis Dragon is the living embodiment of a metaphysical principle expressed through color.

The Color Identity System ensures:

- Every dragon feels unique  
- Every color has a consistent emotional signature  
- Chain variants remain aligned but distinct  
- Future expansions maintain coherence  

Color is not decoration — it is doctrine.

## V.2 — The Four Layers of Color Identity
Each color expresses itself through four interconnected layers:

### **1. Emotional Layer**
The feeling the color evokes.

### **2. Metaphysical Layer**
The cosmic principle the color governs.

### **3. Visual Layer**
How the color manifests in materials, lighting, and silhouette.

### **4. Symbolic Layer**
The geometric or abstract symbols tied to the color.

All four layers must be present in every depiction.

## V.3 — Universal Color Rules
These rules apply to all 32 colors:

- No muddy midtones  
- No desaturated “gray zones” unless intentional  
- Highlights must push toward the color’s brightest expression  
- Shadows must deepen the core hue, not neutralize it  
- Complementary colors may appear only as accents  
- No neon or artificial saturation  
- No gradients that break the color’s emotional identity  

Color must always feel mythic, intentional, and sovereign.
