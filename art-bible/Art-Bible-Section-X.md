# ART BIBLE v1.0  
## Section X — Material & Surface Rules  
*(Scales, Horns, Wings, Eyes, Special Effects)*

---

## X.1 — Purpose of Material Consistency
Materials define the physical reality of the Genesis Dragons.  
They determine how light interacts with the creature and how the viewer perceives:

- Weight  
- Age  
- Power  
- Texture  
- Mythic presence  

Material rules ensure every dragon feels like part of the same ancient species.

---

## X.2 — Universal Material Principles
All materials must follow these rules:

- No photorealistic hyper‑detail  
- No plastic shine  
- No metallic reflections unless color‑aligned  
- No sci‑fi surfaces  
- No cartoon flatness  
- Subtle texture, never noise  

Materials must feel ancient, organic, and mythic.

---

## X.3 — Scale Rules
Scales are the primary surface material.

### Allowed:
- Soft specular highlights  
- Subtle texture variation  
- Smooth transitions  
- Slight iridescence (Solana only)  
- Faceted micro‑geometry (Polygon only, subtle)  

### Forbidden:
- Hyper‑real micro‑scales  
- Harsh noise patterns  
- Plastic or rubbery shine  
- Metallic scales unless defined by color identity  

Scales must feel alive, not synthetic.

---

## X.4 — Horn & Crest Rules
Horns and crests define silhouette and identity.

### Universal rules:
- Matte or semi‑matte finish  
- Strong edge highlights  
- No metallic reflections  
- No sci‑fi shapes  
- No overly complex geometry  

### Chain variants:
- **Solana:** Smooth, flowing curvature  
- **Polygon:** Sharper, crystalline angles  

Horns must reinforce the dragon’s color and chain identity.

---

## X.5 — Wing Membrane Rules
Wings are the most expressive material.

### Required characteristics:
- Slight translucency  
- Soft gradients  
- Visible tension  
- Smooth curvature  
- Light passing through membrane  

### Forbidden:
- Feathers  
- Mechanical joints  
- Harsh veins  
- Torn or damaged membranes (unless lore‑specific)  

Wings must feel powerful, elegant, and mythic.

---

## X.6 — Eye Material Rules
Eyes are the emotional core.

### Allowed:
- Controlled luminosity  
- Subtle glow  
- Smooth gradients  
- Deep, reflective depth  

### Forbidden:
- Cartoon shine  
- Laser‑like glow  
- Human‑like pupils  
- Overly bright neon colors  

Eyes must convey intelligence and cosmic awareness.

---

## X.7 — Special Material Effects
Special effects must be used sparingly and only when aligned with color identity.

### Allowed (subtle):
- Iridescence (Solana)  
- Crystalline edges (Polygon)  
- Soft internal glow  
- Color‑aligned aura haze  

### Forbidden:
- Sparks  
- Flames (unless color‑aligned)  
- Sci‑fi energy fields  
- Particle effects  
- Neon outlines  

Effects must enhance, not distract.

---

## X.8 — Chain‑Specific Material Variants

### **Solana Material Style**
- Fluid transitions  
- Organic glow  
- Soft iridescence  
- Smooth curvature  
- Warm, living textures  

### **Polygon Material Style**
- Faceted reflections  
- Crystalline tension  
- Sharp transitions  
- Structured glow  
- Cool, engineered textures  

Both must remain subtle and consistent.

---

## X.9 — Material Consistency Mandate
All dragons must follow:

- The same scale logic  
- The same horn and crest rules  
- The same wing membrane structure  
- The same eye material identity  
- The same chain‑specific material variants  

Materials define the physical reality of the Empire.  
They must remain stable across all eras, artists, and expansions.
