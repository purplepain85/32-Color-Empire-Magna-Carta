# ART BIBLE v1.0  
## Section XVI — Cross‑Chain Consistency Rules  
*(Solana vs Polygon: Visual, Metadata, Lore, and Structural Alignment)*

---

## XVI.1 — Purpose of Cross‑Chain Consistency
The Empire exists across **two chains** — Solana and Polygon.  
To maintain unity, every Genesis Dragon must remain:

- Visually consistent  
- Metaphysically consistent  
- Structurally consistent  
- Narratively consistent  
- Mathematically consistent  

Chain differences must **enhance identity**, not fracture it.

---

## XVI.2 — The Three Pillars of Cross‑Chain Identity
Each chain expresses the same dragon through:

1. **Visual Expression Variant**  
2. **Metadata Variant**  
3. **Lore Tone Variant**

These three pillars must always align with the same core identity.

---

## XVI.3 — Visual Expression Differences

### **Solana Visual Style**
- Fluid transitions  
- Organic glow  
- Soft gradients  
- Warm, living textures  
- Slight iridescence  

Solana dragons feel **alive with light**.

### **Polygon Visual Style**
- Structured reflections  
- Crystalline highlights  
- Sharper transitions  
- Cool, engineered textures  
- Faceted light behavior  

Polygon dragons feel **forged by cosmic geometry**.

Both must remain subtle and never contradict the dragon’s core color identity.

---

## XVI.4 — Metadata Differences

### **Solana Metadata**
- Organic terminology  
- Fluid descriptors  
- Soft gradient references  
- Iridescent material tags  

### **Polygon Metadata**
- Geometric terminology  
- Structured descriptors  
- Crystalline material tags  
- Faceted light references  

Metadata differences must be stylistic, not structural.

---

## XVI.5 — Lore Tone Differences

### **Solana Lore Tone**
- Warm  
- Fluid  
- Poetic  
- Organic metaphors  
- References to flow, life, and light  

### **Polygon Lore Tone**
- Cool  
- Precise  
- Geometric metaphors  
- References to structure, clarity, and judgment  

Both must express the same metaphysical truth through different voices.

---

## XVI.6 — Forbidden Cross‑Chain Divergences
These break the Empire’s constitutional law:

- Different poses  
- Different anatomy  
- Different symbolic geometry  
- Different backgrounds  
- Different color identity  
- Different rarity tier  
- Different metadata categories  
- Different lore meaning  

Chains may differ in **style**, never in **substance**.

---

## XVI.7 — Cross‑Chain Rendering Rules
Both chains must follow:

- The same lighting hierarchy  
- The same material rules  
- The same background complexity  
- The same silhouette clarity  
- The same pose categories  

Only the **style of light behavior** may differ.

---

## XVI.8 — Cross‑Chain Metadata Alignment
Metadata must remain:

- Identical in structure  
- Identical in category order  
- Identical in trait meaning  
- Identical in rarity logic  

Only the **descriptor style** may differ.

---

## XVI.9 — Cross‑Chain Lore Alignment
Lore must remain:

- Identical in metaphysical meaning  
- Identical in symbolic geometry  
- Identical in emotional identity  
- Ident
