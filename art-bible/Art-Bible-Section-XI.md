## Section XI — Motion, Energy & Aura Rules  
*(Mythic Energy Behavior, Subtle Effects, Chain Variants)*

---

## XI.1 — Purpose of Motion & Aura Rules
Motion and aura effects define the **living presence** of a Genesis Dragon.  
They communicate:

- Power  
- Emotion  
- Elemental identity  
- Chain alignment  
- Mythic scale  

These effects must always be **subtle, intentional, and color‑aligned**.

---

## XI.2 — Universal Motion Principles
Motion must follow these rules:

- Smooth, controlled movement  
- No chaotic or frantic motion  
- No cartoon exaggeration  
- No motion blur that obscures anatomy  
- No sci‑fi streaks or digital trails  

Motion must feel ancient, deliberate, and sovereign.

---

## XI.3 — Allowed Motion Types

### **1. Subtle Wing Motion**
- Slight membrane tension  
- Controlled curvature  
- Soft atmospheric displacement  

### **2. Tail Flow**
- Smooth S‑curves  
- Gentle counterbalance  
- No whipping or snapping  

### **3. Breath Motion**
- Slow, mythic exhalation  
- Color‑aligned haze  
- No fire unless color‑aligned  

### **4. Micro‑Gestures**
- Eye shifts  
- Claw flexing  
- Chest expansion  

Motion must enhance presence, not distract.

---

## XI.4 — Forbidden Motion Types
These break the Empire’s tone:

- Cartoon flapping  
- Rapid or chaotic movement  
- Anime‑style speed lines  
- Sci‑fi energy trails  
- Excessive motion blur  
- Comedic gestures  
- Human‑like waving or pointing  

Dragons move with ancient purpose.

## XI.5 — Aura & Energy Rules
Auras represent the dragon’s metaphysical essence.

### Allowed (subtle):
- Soft glow  
- Color‑aligned haze  
- Gentle radiance  
- Atmospheric shimmer  
- Symbolic geometry faintly illuminated  

### Forbidden:
- Neon glow  
- Sparks or particle bursts  
- Lightning unless color‑aligned  
- Fire unless color‑aligned  
- Sci‑fi holograms  
- Rainbow gradients  

Aura must feel mythic, not magical or technological.

---

## XI.6 — Color‑Aligned Aura Behavior
Each color expresses energy differently:

- **Crimson:** Warm, directional radiance  
- **Azure:** Cool, soft diffusion  
- **Jade:** Organic, natural shimmer  
- **Obsidian:** Reflective shadow edges  
- **Pearl:** Halo‑like illumination  

Aura must reinforce the color’s emotional and metaphysical identity.

---

## XI.7 — Chain‑Specific Aura Variants

### **Solana Aura Style**
- Fluid, organic glow  
- Soft iridescence  
- Warm, living energy  
- Gentle motion within the aura  
- Slight color shifting allowed  

Solana energy feels alive.

### **Polygon Aura Style**
- Structured glow  
- Crystalline radiance  
- Sharp, geometric edges  
- Stable, precise energy  
- No color shifting  

Polygon energy feels engineered by cosmic law.

---

## XI.8 — Interaction with Background & Lighting
Aura must integrate with:

- Lighting direction  
- Background complexity  
- Color identity  
- Pose and silhouette  

Aura must never overpower the dragon or distort readability.

---

## XI.9 — Forbidden Aura Practices
These violate the Empire’s visual law:

- Overly bright halos  
- Chaotic particle effects  
- Fireworks‑like bursts  
- Sci‑fi energy fields  
- Excessive glow that hides anatomy  
- Auras that contradict color identity  

Aura must remain mythic, ancient, and controlled.

---

## XI.10 — Motion & Aura Consistency Mandate
All dragons must follow:

- The same motion logic  
- The same aura rules  
- The same chain‑specific energy identity  
- The same color‑aligned behavior  

Motion and aura define the dragon’s living presence.  
They must remain stable across all eras, artists, and expansions.
