# ART BIBLE v1.0  
## Section IX — Lighting & Rendering Rules  
*(Light Sources, Shadow Logic, Material Response, Chain Variants)*

---

## IX.1 — Purpose of Lighting in the Empire
Lighting defines:

- Mood  
- Depth  
- Material identity  
- Color purity  
- Mythic presence  

Lighting is not just illumination — it is narrative.

Every Genesis Dragon must feel like it exists in a world governed by ancient cosmic light.

---

## IX.2 — Universal Lighting Principles
All dragons must follow these lighting rules:

- One primary light source  
- One optional secondary fill light  
- Soft, cinematic shadows  
- No harsh contrast unless color‑aligned  
- Lighting must enhance silhouette clarity  
- Lighting must reinforce color identity  

Lighting must feel mythic, not photographic.

---

## IX.3 — Primary Light Source Rules
The primary light source must:

- Come from a clear direction  
- Define the dragon’s form  
- Highlight the face, chest, and wings  
- Maintain consistent intensity  
- Avoid flattening the silhouette  

The primary light is the dragon’s “cosmic spotlight.”

---

## IX.4 — Secondary Light Source Rules
Secondary light is optional and must be subtle.

Allowed uses:

- Soft fill to reveal form  
- Color‑aligned rim light  
- Atmospheric bounce light  

Forbidden uses:

- Neon rim lights  
- Harsh backlighting  
- Multiple conflicting light directions  
- Sci‑fi glow effects  

Secondary light must support, not compete.

---

## IX.5 — Shadow Logic
Shadows must:

- Deepen the core color  
- Maintain readability  
- Follow anatomical structure  
- Avoid muddying the form  
- Reinforce the dragon’s mass and presence  

Forbidden:

- Pure black shadows  
- Random shadow noise  
- Harsh, unrealistic edges  

Shadows must feel ancient and atmospheric.

---

## IX.6 — Material Response Rules
Each material on the dragon responds to light differently:

### **Scales**
- Soft specular highlights  
- Subtle texture  
- No plastic shine  
- No micro‑detail noise  

### **Horns**
- Matte or semi‑matte  
- Stronger edge highlights  
- No metallic reflections  

### **Wings**
- Slight translucency  
- Light passing through membrane  
- Soft gradients  

### **Eyes**
- Luminous but controlled  
- No glowing beams  
- No cartoon shine  

Materials must feel mythic and natural.
