# ART BIBLE v1.0  
## Section VIII — Backgrounds & Environmental Rules  
*(Atmosphere, Scale, Composition, Chain Variants)*

---

## VIII.1 — Purpose of Backgrounds
Backgrounds exist to **support** the dragon, not compete with it.  
They must:

- Reinforce the dragon’s color identity  
- Establish mythic scale  
- Provide atmospheric depth  
- Maintain clarity and readability  
- Never overpower the subject  

The dragon is always the focal point.

---

## VIII.2 — Background Complexity Levels
Backgrounds follow a strict hierarchy of complexity:

### **Level 1 — Minimalist (Default)**
- Soft gradients  
- Subtle atmospheric haze  
- Light texture  
- No objects or scenery  

Used for most Genesis Dragon portraits.

### **Level 2 — Symbolic**
- Abstract geometry  
- Faint color‑aligned motifs  
- Subtle chain‑specific accents  

Used for special editions or lore‑aligned pieces.

### **Level 3 — Environmental**
- Full scenery  
- Mythic landscapes  
- Atmospheric storytelling  

Used sparingly for narrative art, not standard Genesis portraits.

---

## VIII.3 — Composition Rules
Background composition must follow these principles:

- Dragon occupies 60–75% of the frame  
- Background elements must not intersect the silhouette  
- No clutter behind the head or wings  
- Lighting direction must match the dragon  
- Depth must be created through atmospheric perspective  

The background must enhance the dragon’s presence.

---

## VIII.4 — Atmospheric Rules
Atmosphere is the key to mythic scale.

### Allowed:
- Soft fog  
- Light rays  
- Subtle glow  
- Color‑aligned haze  
- Depth‑enhancing gradients  

### Forbidden:
- Harsh smoke  
- Chaotic particle effects  
- Sci‑fi energy fields  
- Realistic weather (rain, snow, storms) unless defined by the color’s identity  

Atmosphere must feel ancient and cosmic.

## VIII.5 — Chain‑Specific Environmental Variants

### **Solana Background Style**
- Fluid gradients  
- Organic light diffusion  
- Soft, luminous haze  
- Subtle iridescence  
- Background feels alive  

### **Polygon Background Style**
- Structured gradients  
- Geometric light patterns  
- Crystalline reflections  
- Sharp atmospheric layering  
- Background feels engineered  

Both must remain subtle and supportive.

---

## VIII.6 — Color‑Aligned Background Rules
Each color influences its background:

- **Crimson:** Warm, directional glow  
- **Azure:** Cool, soft gradients  
- **Jade:** Organic, natural transitions  
- **Obsidian:** Deep shadows with reflective edges  
- **Pearl:** Radiant, soft halos  

Backgrounds must never introduce colors that contradict the dragon’s identity.

---

## VIII.7 — Forbidden Background Practices
These break the Empire’s visual law:

- Busy or cluttered scenery  
- Real‑world objects (trees, buildings, mountains) in standard portraits  
- Neon or artificial lighting  
- High‑contrast patterns  
- Backgrounds brighter than the dragon  
- Elements that obscure the silhouette  

The background must always serve the dragon.

---

## VIII.8 — Background Integration with Pose & Lighting
Backgrounds must integrate seamlessly with:

- The dragon’s pose  
- The lighting direction  
- The color identity  
- The symbolic geometry  
- The chain variant
