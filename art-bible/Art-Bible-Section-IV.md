# ART BIBLE v1.0  
## Section IV — Posing & Expression Rules  
*(Gesture, Motion, Emotion, Cinematic Presence)*

---

## IV.1 — Purpose of Pose Consistency
Poses define the dragon’s personality, presence, and mythic weight.  
A Genesis Dragon must always feel:

- Sovereign  
- Ancient  
- Intelligent  
- Powerful without aggression  
- Majestic without arrogance  

Poses must reinforce the Empire’s tone and visual law.

---

## IV.2 — Core Posing Principles
All poses must follow these universal rules:

- Clear, readable silhouette  
- Balanced weight distribution  
- Natural anatomical flow  
- Controlled gesture (no chaotic motion)  
- Cinematic presence  
- Mythic stillness or deliberate movement  

A Genesis Dragon never looks clumsy, goofy, or frantic.

- Tail curved naturally  
- Head elevated with calm authority  

### **2. Dynamic Wing Spread**
- Wings extended in a controlled arc  
- Chest forward  
- Tail counterbalancing  
- Silhouette must remain readable  

### **3. Perched or Elevated Pose**

## IV.4 — Forbidden Poses
These break the Empire’s tone and are not allowed:

- Cartoonish roaring  
- Overly aggressive attack poses  
- Chaotic flailing wings  
- Running like a dog or horse  
- Human‑like gestures (waving, pointing, etc.)

The dragons are mythic sovereigns — never caricatures.

Expressions must be subtle and powerful.

### Allowed:

- Smooth S‑curves  
- Gentle arcs  
- Subtle tension
