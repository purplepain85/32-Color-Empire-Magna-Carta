## Section III — Anatomy of a Genesis Dragon  
*(Silhouette, Proportions, Structure, Chain Variants)*

---

## III.1 — The Purpose of Anatomical Consistency
The anatomy of a Genesis Dragon is the backbone of the Empire’s visual identity.  
Every dragon must share a unified structural language so that:

- The Pantheon feels cohesive  
- Chain differences remain meaningful  
- Poses remain interchangeable  
- Artists and AI can reproduce the form reliably  

Anatomy is not just biology — it is visual law.

## III.2 — The Core Silhouette
A Genesis Dragon’s silhouette must be instantly recognizable, even without detail.

### Required silhouette elements:
- A long, balanced neck  
- A powerful chest and ribcage  
- Four limbs (no bipedal variants)  
- A long, tapering tail  
- Two wings with a clear membrane structure  
- A horned or crested head  
- A forward‑leaning, predatory posture  

### Silhouette principles:
- No cartoon exaggeration  
- No bulky, dinosaur‑like proportions  
- No serpentine, limbless forms  
- No mechanical or sci‑fi shapes  

The silhouette must communicate **ancient sovereignty**, not aggression.

---

## III.3 — Proportional Framework
All Genesis Dragons follow a proportional grid to maintain consistency.

### Body proportions:
- Head: 1 unit  
- Neck: 1.5 units  
- Torso: 2 units  
- Tail: 3–4 units  
- Wingspan: 5–6 units  
- Limb length: proportional to torso, never oversized  

### Key proportional rules:
- The torso is the visual anchor  
- The wings must always feel capable of flight  
- The tail provides balance and elegance  
- The head must never be oversized or cartoonish  

Proportions must feel mythic yet biologically plausible.

## III.4 — Head & Facial Structure
The head is the emotional center of the dragon.

### Required features:
- Strong brow ridge  
- Forward‑facing eyes  
- Defined jawline  
- Horns or crest unique to the color  
- Subtle asymmetry for realism  

### Forbidden:
- Goofy expressions  
- Overly human features  
- Flat or textureless faces  

The face must convey intelligence, age, and cosmic awareness.

---

## III.5 — Wings & Flight Anatomy
Wings define the dragon’s majesty.

### Wing structure:
- One primary bone arc  
- One secondary support arc  
- Membrane stretched between arcs  
- Slight translucency  
- Visible tension and curvature  

### Wing rules:
- Wings must never appear mechanical  
- No bat‑like hyper‑realism  
- No feathered wings  
- No tiny “decorative” wings  

Wings must feel powerful enough to lift a mythic being.

---

## III.6 — Limbs & Claws
The limbs must balance strength and elegance.

### Limb rules:
- Four limbs, digitigrade stance  
- Muscular but not bulky  
- Claws sharp but not exaggerated  
- Elbows and knees clearly defined  

### Forbidden:
- Human‑like hands  
- Oversized monster claws  
- Cartoon paw shapes  

The limbs must feel functional, ancient, and regal.

---

## III.7 — Tail Structure
The tail is a stabilizer and a visual counterweight.

### Tail rules:
- Long and tapering  
- Smooth curvature  
- Optional color‑specific ornamentation  
- No spikes, blades, or sci‑fi elements  

The tail must enhance silhouette flow.

---

## III.8 — Chain‑Specific Anatomical Variants

### Solana Dragons
- More fluid curvature  
- Softer transitions between body segments  
- Slightly elongated neck and tail  
- Wing membranes more translucent  
- Horns and crests shaped like flowing energy  

### Polygon Dragons
- More geometric structure  
- Sharper angles in horns and crests  
- Slightly broader chest  
- Wing membranes with crystalline tension  
- Tail tip may have subtle faceted geometry  

These differences must be **subtle but unmistakable**.

---

## III.9 — Anatomical Consistency Mandate
All Genesis Dragons must follow:

- The same skeletal logic  
- The same proportional grid
