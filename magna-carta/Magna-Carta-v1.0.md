# MAGNA CARTA OF THE 32‑COLOR EMPIRE  
### Version 1.0 — Immutable Constitutional Framework

---

## I. PURPOSE OF THE EMPIRE
The 32‑Color Empire exists to create a transparent, fair, and compounding ecosystem where art, lore, governance, and financial structure operate under immutable rules.  
Every participant is protected by clarity, determinism, and equal access to information.

---

## II. THE GENESIS DRAGONS
1. There are exactly **32 Genesis Dragons**, each tied to one unique color from the official palette.  
2. Each Genesis Dragon is:
   - A sovereign artifact  
   - A container root  
   - A governance seat  
   - A revenue‑bearing asset  
3. Genesis Dragons cannot be duplicated, replaced, or altered.  
4. Ownership of a Genesis Dragon grants:
   - Voting rights  
   - Commission rights  
   - Access to private write permissions  
   - A permanent share of Empire‑wide compounding  

---

## III. CONTAINER HIERARCHY
1. The Empire uses a deterministic, index‑based container system.  
2. Every container has:
   - A unique ID  
   - A parent container  
   - A creation timestamp  
   - Immutable metadata  
3. Containers are append‑only.  
4. Only Genesis holders and project owners may write to containers.  
5. All containers are publicly readable.

---

## IV. COMMISSIONS & ECONOMIC FLOW
1. Every artifact minted within the Empire pays a **commission** to:
   - The Genesis Dragon of its color  
   - The Empire Vault  
   - The project owner  
2. Commissions are:
   - Automatic  
   - Immutable  
   - Transparent  
3. The Empire Vault compounds daily.  
4. Daily compounding is mandatory, even if automation fails.  
5. Vault distributions occur at fixed intervals and are publicly logged.

---

## V. GOVERNANCE
1. Governance is conducted by the 32 Genesis holders.  
2. Each Genesis Dragon equals **one vote**.  
3. Governance actions include:
   - Approving new projects  
   - Adjusting commission splits (within allowed ranges)  
   - Approving lore expansions  
   - Approving new container types  
4. No governance action may violate:
   - Immutability  
   - Deterministic indexing  
   - Public readability  
   - Commission guarantees  

---

## VI. LORE & ART
1. All lore must remain consistent with:
   - The 32‑Color Pantheon  
   - The Genesis Dragon identities  
   - The Empire’s metaphysics  
2. The Art Bible defines:
   - Style  
   - Symbolism  
   - Color usage  
   - Composition rules  
3. No artwork may contradict the Art Bible once published.

---

## VII. PUBLIC ACCESS & TRANSPARENCY
1. All containers are publicly readable.  
2. All financial flows are publicly visible.  
3. All governance votes are publicly logged.

2. All writes must:
   - Follow the container schema  
   - Preserve immutability  
   - Append only  
3. No one may alter or delete past entries.

---

## IX. SECURITY & IMMUTABILITY
1. No rule in this Magna Carta may be altered except by:
   - A unanimous vote of all 32 Genesis holders  
2. No past data may be modified.  
3. No container may be deleted.  
4. No Genesis Dragon may be replaced.
